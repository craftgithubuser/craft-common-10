1.what is Data?
ans 
-.data is unorganised and unrefined facts

2.what is Information?
-information comprise processed,organized data presented 
in a meaningful contex.

3.what is Database(DB)?
a database is an organized collection of data stored and 
  accessed electronically from a computer system

4.What is the Relation Database Management System(RDBMS)?
the software used to store,manage ,query,and 
retrieve data stored in a relational database.


5.Define the importance of Relation Database Management System(RDBMS)?
for storing,retrieving and manipulating the data.

6.As we all know that there are Two types of Database. 
Relational Database(SQL) AND Non-Relational DB(NO sql). what is the difference between them.

ans) relational Database--data is easily structured into categories.
                        --data is consistent in input,meaning and easy to navigate.
                       --relationship can be easily defined between data points.
 ans)Non-RELATIONAL DATABASE--data is not confined to a structureed group
                            --you can perform function that allow for greater flexibility
                            --your data and analyis can be more dynamic and allow for more variant
                            inputs.

7.List examples of Relation Database Management System(RDBMS)?
  ans)LIST  RDBMS---MySQL
                --- ActorDB  
                ----Oracle
                ----eXtremeDB
                ----Amazon Aurora
                ---- Microsoft SQL Server
                -----SQL Azure
                ----SQLBase

8.List examples of Non-Relational DB(Nosql)? 
ans) list NON RDB   ----Oracle Berkeley DB
                    ---Amazon Elasticache
                    ---BigTable

9.Define and Describe is Structured Query Language(SQL)?
    
SQL is a standard language for storing, manipulating and retrieving data in databases. 

10.List and Describe each of the different subsets of SQL(Mean DDL, DML, DCL, TCL)?
  ans) **DDL-DATA DEFINITION LANGUAGE-define the schema of the database
       DDL commands are CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE, etc. 
     **DML--  DATA Manipulation Language (DML) -THE DML STATEMENTS OPERATING ON ROWS.
      DML commands are INSERT, UPDATE,DELETE, SELECT.
    **DCL-DCL stands for Data Control Language
       DCL COMMANDS ARE GRANT,REVOKE,DENY
    **  TCL -TCL(transaction Control Language):
        TCL commands deal with the transaction within the database.
          COMMIT–
          ROLLBACK– 
          SAVEPOINT-
          SET TRANSACTION,
11.what is table in Database(DB)?
--- A table is made up of rows and columns.  

   
12.what is column and Row(tuples) in table?
Columns--are defined to hold a specific type of data, such as dates, numeric, or textual data.  
In the simplest of definitions a column is defined by its name and data type.  
COLOMUN -- the arrangement of DATA  in a vertical manner forms a column.
ROW--a row is a horizontal arrangement of DATA in order or the visualization of DATA horizontally.
